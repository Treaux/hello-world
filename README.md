# hello-world

Use this as a baseline to see how far your coding skills have progressed.

Today's date is June 17, 2016 and this is the day that I learn to start coding.
Today is also your dad's birthday, so make sure you do something for him as well.
Best of luck to you on your journey, Leonard ;)
